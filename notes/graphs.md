# Graphs
## Mathematical Model
- Trees have one edge for a parent-child relationship (nodes = n - 1).
- A graph G is...
    - An ordered pair of a set V of vertices and E of edges.
    - G = (V, E)
    - V and E are an ordered pair! (a, b) !== (b, a)
- Edges
    - Directed vs Undirected
    - Undirected ~ bi-directional
